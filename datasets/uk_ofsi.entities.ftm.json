The Presidential Office is a state body providing support for the President’s work and monitoring the implementation of the President’s decisions and overall Governmental policies and most important action. Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny was the victim of an attempted assassination during his August 2020 visit to Siberia, in which a chemical weapon—a toxic nerve agent of the Novichok group—was used. The activities and movements of Alexey Navalny during his journey to Siberia, from where he intended to return to Moscow on 20th August 2020, were closely monitored by the authorities of the Russian Federation, including the Federal Security Service (FSB). Russia had the technical capability to carry out the attack. The Russian State has previously produced Novichoks and would still be capable of doing so. Within the last decade, Russia has produced and stockpiled small quantities of Novichok. It is unlikely that Novichoks could be made and deployed by non-state actors (e.g. a criminal or terrorist group). Russia had the operational experience to carry out the attack. Russia has a proven record of state-sponsored assassination. It is highly likely that the Russian state was responsible for the attempted assassination of Sergei Skripal in Salisbury in 2018 using a similar type of nerve agent. During the 2000s, Russia commenced a programme to test means of delivering chemical warfare agents, including investigation of ways of delivering nerve agents. Russia had the motive and opportunity to carry out the attack. Navalny was a high profile Russian opposition politician who vocally criticised the Russian administration and establishment. He was on Russian territory under surveillance by the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation at the time of the attack. Given the role of the state within the attack, and the scale of the operation against Navalny, it is reasonable to conclude that the poisoning of Alexey Navalny was only possible with the consent of the Presidential Executive Office. As Chief of the Presidential Domestic Policy Directorate in the Presidential Executive Office, Andrei Veniaminovich Yarin bears responsibility for the preparation, support for and use of chemical weapons in the attempted assassination of Alexey Navalny."],"name":["Andrei Veniaminovich Yarin"],"birthPlace":["Russia"],"birthDate":["1970-02-13"],"nationality":["Russia"],"position":["Chief of the Presidential Domestic Policy Directorate"],"createdAt":["2020-10-15T00:00:00"],"modifiedAt":["2022-03-18T00:00:00"]},"datasets":["uk_ofsi_sanctions"]}

Kara-Murza was subsequently found guilty of three charges, including disseminating false information about the Russian Armed Forces under part 2 of Article 207.3 of the Russian Criminal Code, one of the so-called “fake news” laws. POTYCHKO was also involved in the criminal proceedings against Ilya Yashin under the same law, and made public comment regarding preventing Yashin from expressing anti-war views to journalists during those proceedings. This law and its application and enforcement by prosecutors and courts is a result of the Russian Government’s policy to prevent the Russian public from knowing the truth about the conflict in Ukraine.

José Adelino Ornelas Ferreira has been Second in Command and Chief of Staff of Strategic Command Operations of the Bolivarian National Armed Forces (CEOFANB) since June 2017, having been appointed to the post by Nicolas Maduro. The CEOFANB is the highest point of command in the Venezuelan armed forces. The CEOFANB sets the strategic direction of all strands of the Venezuelan military (Army, Navy, Air Force, and National Guard (GNB)), coordinates them, and implements operations. Since September 2020, Ornelas has been the Chief of the General Staff to the Commander in Chief. There is reliable evidence that the GNB has committed serious human rights violations during Ferreira’s period in charge. A report by OHCHR in 2018 documents incidents of people deprived of their liberty and subjected to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment and (in many cases possibly) torture, reportedly carried out in part by the GNB.  Some of these incidents occurred in the period that Ferreira has held the position of Commander of the CEOFANB. As a commander of the CEOFANB, and Chief of Staff to the Commander in Chief and Strategic Command Operations, and thus in charge of the GNB, there are reasonable grounds to suspect that Ferreira was involved in those acts. There is reliable evidence that the GNB used excessive force against people in the Pemon territory in February 2019, including killing three people, and carried out extrajudicial killings of an alleged terrorist group in El Junquito, Caracas. As a CEOFANB Commander and Chief of Staff at the time, there are reasonable grounds to suspect that Ferreira was involved in those grave human rights violations. Finally, there is reliable evidence that In May 2019 members of the Venezuelan National Guard (GNB), which sits under the command of the CEOFANB, during Ferreira’s time in role, used tear gas to disperse a march of opposition supporters.  Due to his role, Ferreira is partially responsible for this repression of civil society and violation of freedom of expression.","Non-Latin name: José Adelino Ornelas Ferreira"],"name":["Jose Adelino ORNELA FERREIRA","Jose Adelino ORNELAS FERREIRA","Jose Adelino ORNELLA FERREIRA","Jose Adelino ORNELLAS FERREIRA"],"addressEntity":["Venezuela"],"birthPlace":["Venezuela"],"birthDate":["1964-12-14"],"nationality":["Venezuela"],"position":["(1) Chief of Staff of the Commander in Chief of the Venezuelan Armed Forces (2) Deputy Minister of Monitoring and Inspection of Government Administration (3) Secretary General of the National Defence Council (SECODENA) (4) Former Second-in-Command of CEOFANB (5) Chief of Staff of CEOFANB"],"createdAt":["2020-06-30T00:00:00"],"modifiedAt":["2022-08-02T00:00:00"]},"datasets":["uk_ofsi_sanctions"]}
