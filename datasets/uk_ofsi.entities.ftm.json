There is reasonable grounds to suspect that\n            the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation was involved in the attempted\n            assassination of Alexey Navalny using a toxic nerve agent. As Head of the \"2nd Service\"\n            Unit, Sedov is responsible for, engaged in, provided support for, or promoted the\n            activities conducted by this unit in the FSB. Alternatively, he is associated with those\n            who did. This designation is part of a further package of designations targeting the FSB\n            operatives directly involved in carrying out the operation.\n            Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny was the victim of an attempted assassination\n            during his August 2020 visit to Siberia, in which a chemical weapon - a toxic nerve\n            agent of the Novichok group - was used. The activities and movements of Alexey Navalny\n            during his journey to Siberia, from where he intended to return to Moscow on 20th August\n            2020, were closely monitored by the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation.\n            Russia had the technical capability to carry out the attack. The Russian State has\n            previously produced Novichoks and would still be capable of doing so. Within the last\n            decade, Russia has produced and stockpiled small quantities of Novichok. It is unlikely\n            that Novichoks could be made and deployed by non-state actors (e.g. a criminal or\n            terrorist group).\n            Russia had the operational experience to carry out the attack. Russia has a proven\n            record of state-sponsored assassination. It is highly likely that the Russian state was\n            responsible for the attempted assassination of Sergei Skripal in Salisbury in 2018 using\n            a similar type of nerve agent. During the 2000s, Russia commenced a programme to test\n            means of delivering chemical warfare agents, including investigation of ways of\n            delivering nerve agents.\n            Russia had the motive and opportunity to carry out the attack. Navalny is a high profile\n            Russian opposition politician who vocally criticised the Russian administration and\n            establishment. He was on Russian territory under surveillance by the Federal Security\n            Service of the Russian Federation at the time of the attack."],"name":["Alexei Semenovich Sedov"],"addressEntity":[" "],"birthDate":["1954"],"position":["Head of FSB 2nd Service"],"createdAt":["2021-08-20T00:00:00"],"modifiedAt":["2022-06-16T00:00:00"]},"datasets":["uk_fst_sanctions"]}

Kara-Murza was subsequently found guilty of three charges, including\n            disseminating false information about the Russian Armed Forces under part 2 of Article\n            207.3 of the Russian Criminal Code, one of the so-called “fake news” laws. POTYCHKO was\n            also involved in the criminal proceedings against Ilya Yashin under the same law, and\n            made public comment regarding preventing Yashin from expressing anti-war views to\n            journalists during those proceedings. This law and its application and enforcement by\n            prosecutors and courts is a result of the Russian Government’s policy to prevent the\n            Russian public from knowing the truth about the conflict in Ukraine. This policy\n            prevents the spread of accurate information about the conflict in Ukraine, as well as\n            anti-war sentiment and dissent, which would reduce public support for the war and\n            undermine the Russian Government’s ability to wage the war. In this way, the policy is\n            facilitating the continuation of the war, which is destabilising Ukraine and undermining\n            its territorial integrity and sovereignty. POTYCHKO’s involvement as part of the\n            prosecution team in the criminal proceedings against Kara-Murza, her appearance on\n            behalf of the prosecution to oppose the appeal against preventative detention, and her\n            involvement in and statement regarding the proceedings against Yashin demonstrate that\n            she is an involved person because she is providing support for a policy that is\n            destabilising Ukraine and undermining its territorial integrity and sovereignty.

José Adelino Ornelas Ferreira has been Second in\n            Command and Chief of Staff of Strategic Command Operations of the Bolivarian National\n            Armed Forces (CEOFANB) since June 2017, having been appointed to the post by Nicolas\n            Maduro. The CEOFANB is the highest point of command in the Venezuelan armed forces. The\n            CEOFANB sets the strategic direction of all strands of the Venezuelan military (Army,\n            Navy, Air Force, and National Guard (GNB)), coordinates them, and implements operations.\n            Since September 2020, Ornelas has been the Chief of the General Staff to the Commander\n            in Chief. There is reliable evidence that the GNB has committed serious human rights\n            violations during Ferreira’s period in charge. A report by OHCHR in 2018 documents\n            incidents of people deprived of their liberty and subjected to cruel, inhuman and\n            degrading treatment and (in many cases possibly) torture, reportedly carried out in part\n            by the GNB. Some of these incidents occurred in the period that Ferreira has held the\n            position of Commander of the CEOFANB. As a commander of the CEOFANB, and Chief of Staff\n            to the Commander in Chief and Strategic Command Operations, and thus in charge of the\n            GNB, there are reasonable grounds to suspect that Ferreira was involved in those acts.\n            There is reliable evidence that the GNB used excessive force against people in the Pemon\n            territory in February 2019, including killing three people, and carried out\n            extrajudicial killings of an alleged terrorist group in El Junquito, Caracas. As a\n            CEOFANB Commander and Chief of Staff at the time, there are reasonable grounds to\n            suspect that Ferreira was involved in those grave human rights violations. Finally,\n            there is reliable evidence that In May 2019 members of the Venezuelan National Guard\n            (GNB), which sits under the command of the CEOFANB, during Ferreira’s time in role, used\n            tear gas to disperse a march of opposition supporters.
